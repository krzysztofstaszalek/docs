Where:

- PROXY_IP – IP of the proxy

**Step 5 –** Remove the # before each entry to apply the proxy setups.

**Step 6 –** For the ﬁrst proxy setup, EPPCLIENT_HTTPS_PROXY, add the proxy server information in
the address:port:user:password format.

## Client Uninstall

From this section, you can perform a remote uninstall of the Endpoint Protector Client. The
computers will receive the uninstall command at the same time they receive the next set of commands
from the server.

If the computer is oﬄine, it will receive the uninstall command the ﬁrst time it will come online.
When the uninstall button is pressed the computer(s) will be grayed out until the action will be
performed.

The uninstall command can be canceled if it was not already executed.

![Client Uninstall](clientuninstall.webp)

:::note
If the server and Endpoint Protector client can't communicate due to missing server
certiﬁcation validation (when the certiﬁcation validation setting is enabled), uninstall commands
can't be executed from the Endpoint Protector Server. In such cases, if you're unable to manually
install the certiﬁcate on the Endpoint Protector Client computer, you can temporarily disable the
certiﬁcation validation setting on the Endpoint Protector Server and synchronize the Endpoint
Protector Client to retrieve an uninstall command.
